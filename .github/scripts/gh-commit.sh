# Commit the STAGED changes onto <branch> as a GitHub-signed commit, via the
# createCommitOnBranch GraphQL API. Commits made with GITHUB_TOKEN are signed by
# GitHub's web-flow key and show as Verified, so they satisfy branch protection
# that requires signed commits - which a plain CI `git commit` does not.
#
# Stage what to commit first (git add <paths>), exactly as for a normal commit;
# this reads `git diff --cached`. The branch must already exist on the remote.
# The commit is authored as the token identity (github-actions[bot]); no local
# `git push` is needed, as the API moves the remote tip. Local HEAD is then reset
# to the new commit so a following commit in the same job starts clean.
#
# Honors DRY_RUN=true: logs the file changes and makes no commit.
#
# Args: $1  branch          $2  commit message headline
# Env:  GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN (contents:write), GITHUB_REPOSITORY
