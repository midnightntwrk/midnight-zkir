# ZKIR v3 — Agda formalization

This directory contains the Agda mechanization of **ZKIR major version 3**,
tracking this repository's `zkir` crate (pinned at commit `5b593d1`,
`midnight-zkir 3.0.0` — the crate's own source at this commit is
byte-identical to the type/instruction surface at `midnight-ledger`
`92e8bdd3`, before `zkir` was split out into its own repository). It
covers the **full thirteen-type surface** — Native, Bytes32, Jubjub
point/scalar, and the point/base/scalar triples of Secp256k1,
Secp256r1, and Curve25519 — with all 34 instructions over those types.
It does not yet cover the instruction/type batch landed by PR #10
("Bring lost PRs from midnight-ledger"), already on this branch's tip
— see the pin section of the companion spec for details.

Curve25519 is Edwards-form: its identity *has* affine coordinates,
unlike the Weierstrass curves, so its coordinate extraction (`coordsC`)
is total in the trust base (mirroring Jubjub's `coordsJ`) rather than
`Maybe`-wrapped like `coordsK1`/`coordsP` — the one place its contract
shape differs from the other foreign curves.

Companion document: the textual spec
[`docs/zkir-v3-spec.md`](../../docs/zkir-v3-spec.md). The ultimate
source of truth is the Rust implementation.

## Headline results

The development relates the off-circuit interpreter (`preprocess`, a
deterministic function) to the synthesized constraint system (`synth`) at
two levels. All results are `--safe` with **no `postulate`s**; the trust
base is the [`Assumptions`](Assumptions.agda) record, threaded through
every module as a parameter.

**Canonical-witness faithfulness** (`circuit-faithful` in
[`CircuitProof.agda`](CircuitProof.agda)) — the v3 analogue of v2's P5.
For a well-typed producer, given the run-shape data (`BwdWalk` spine and
terminal `Consumed` facts — the analogue of v2's `preprocess-shaped`):

```
preprocess S P ≡ just s  ⇔  satisfies (synth S) (witness-of P s)
```

The shape data is projected from a successful run by
`preprocess→BwdWalk` (the v2 `R⇒preprocess-shaped` analogue): 34
per-instruction step inversions (`step→bwd`) folded by `run→BwdWalk`,
so a caller holding a run needs no hand-built spine.

**Statement soundness, pis-form** (`statement-sound` in
[`StatementSoundness.agda`](StatementSoundness.agda)). From an *arbitrary*
satisfying witness `w` of shape `WShape S w`, a preimage and run are
constructed whose canonical witness agrees with `w` on the public inputs,
whose memory is a sub-assignment of `w` (exact agreement on the run's
domain), and — under the commitment flag — whose commitment randomness
matches `w`'s:

```
producer-WT S → satisfies (synth S) w → WShape S w → SubRealizer S w
```

where a `SubRealizer S w` bundles a preimage `P'` and a final state `s`
with `run-shaped S P' s` and outright `preprocess S P' ≡ just s`,
`pis (witness-of P' s) ≡ pis w`, `mem s ⊑ᵂ w`, the
commitment-randomness agreement under the flag, and a `CommWF`
component (`do-comm S ≡ false → comm-commitment P' ≡ nothing`, excluding
vestigial commitment pairs when the flag is off).

An exact-equality extraction form (`witness-of P' s ≡ w`) is **false** for
v3: the Rust deliberately leaves transcript-input cells and their guards
unconstrained in-circuit, so `w` is free off the run's domain. The `⊑ᵂ`
component is the honest strengthening available.

**Extraction uniqueness** (`statement-unique` and
`statement-sound-unique` in
[`StatementUniqueness.agda`](StatementUniqueness.agda)). Any two
sub-realizers of the same witness have equal preimages and equal states,
and combined with `statement-sound`: **exactly one** `SubRealizer` per
satisfying `WShape` witness — the extractor is a function of the witness.

**Extractor completeness** (`extractor-complete` in
[`StatementSoundness.agda`](StatementSoundness.agda)). The extracted
preimage actually proves: the canonical witness of a `SubRealizer`'s
preimage/state pair itself satisfies the synthesized circuit
(`forward-sa` through the realizer's `preproc-ok` field).

**`WShape` non-vacuity** (`preprocess→WShape` in
[`StatementSoundness.agda`](StatementSoundness.agda)). The canonical
witness of every successful run is in the extraction class: each
`WSteps` conjunct is forced by its step's success (via the `step→bwd`
inversions), so `statement-sound` applies to every honestly-provable
statement.

Four producer checks are decidable and runnable: `producer-SA?`
(single-assignment well-formedness, [`Obligations.agda`](Obligations.agda)),
`producer-WT?` (adds the value-typing pass), `producer-WF2?` (the spec §5.3
bit-count bounds, which the Rust preprocess checks dynamically but the
mechanized `step` deliberately omits), and `WShape?` (witness shape,
[`StatementSoundness.agda`](StatementSoundness.agda)). The WF2 transfer
is itself a theorem (`preprocessʳ-agree`, Obligations): the Rust-faithful
`preprocessʳ`, whose step re-checks the bounds, agrees with `preprocess`
on every WF2-conforming source.

## Trust base and modeling level

The mechanization is parametric in the cryptography: the `Assumptions`
record collects the carriers and the functional contracts of the
`midnight-circuits` chips. Chips — including the range/decomposition
family (`div-mod`, `less-than`, `in-range`, `reconstitute`) — are modeled
at **contract level**: each constraint's `holds` clause states the
canonical semantic answer and trusts the chip that implements it (see the
decision record in spec §7.0). Faithfulness therefore catches
orchestration errors between the off-circuit and in-circuit sides, but
is sound only insofar as `midnight-circuits` is. The Jubjub `from-coordinates`
subgroup contract was verified faithful against the chip source (the
chip enforces membership by in-circuit cofactor-clearing; see the note
in [`Assumptions.agda`](Assumptions.agda)). The `less-than` contract
states the chip's evened operand bound (`max(bits + bits%2, 4)` —
`even4` in [`Circuit.agda`](Circuit.agda)), matching the deployed
circuit; the exact `2^bits` bound the off-circuit run checks is carried
as a `WShape` conjunct and `BwdStep` side data instead. The Secp256k1,
Secp256r1, and Curve25519 limb *decoders* are modeled as the canonical
partial inverses of their respective encoders — see the TRUST NOTEs in
[`Assumptions.agda`](Assumptions.agda).

## Type-checking

See [`../README.md`](../README.md) for the toolchain; checking
[`Main.agda`](Main.agda) verifies the entire `--safe` development:

```sh
agda --safe -i zkir-spec/src zkir-spec/src/zkir-v3/Main.agda
```

A cold check takes a few minutes (CircuitFaithfulness and
StatementSoundness dominate).

## Proof idioms / gotchas (learned the hard way)

- A local variable named `eq` clashes with the `Constraint` constructor
  `eq` (from `constrain-eq`). Name equality variables `ieq` / `e`.
- Implicits don't infer through the non-injective `init` / `synth` /
  `run` / `step` / `out1` — **pin them explicitly** (e.g.
  `init-pi0 {S}{P}{st0}`, `run-extends {P}{S}{s}`).
- To make `do-communications-commitment S` *definitionally* `false`/`true`
  where `synth`/`init` must reduce, use a helper whose arguments contain no
  `do-comm S` (a top-level `with do-comm S` orphans a `where`-block's
  implicits).
- `_⊑_` is a Π over functions `{id v}`; the unifier stalls on
  `⊑-refl`/`⊑-trans` implicits — give them explicitly or η-expand
  (`λ {id}{v} p → g (f p)`).
- The `*-fwd`/`*-bwd` lemmas are stated at the **immediate post-step
  witness** `witness-of P (out1 st out v)`; the program-level lift to the
  final witness is `holds-mono` + `run-extends` (forward) and
  `holds-lower` + the spine's monotonicity data (backward).
- Multi-instruction inductions must **enumerate all 34 instructions**; a
  catch-all leaves `i` opaque and blocks the needed reductions.
- `grep` for lemma names with `[a-zA-Z-]*` misses `bytes32`/`keccak256`
  names (digits) — include `0-9`.
